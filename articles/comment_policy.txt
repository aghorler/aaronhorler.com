STAY ON-TOPIC

- All comments must be on-topic.


BE CONCISE AND UNDERSTANDABLE

- Comments about issues must clearly state the nature of the issue, and the steps taken to resolve it. 

- For example, comments containing solely "does not work" or "did not work" are not allowed.


BE CORRECT

- Comments advising other users to perform incorrect, insecure, or otherwise questionable tasks are not allowed.


DON'T BE MEAN

-Hateful, discriminatory, rude, or comments containing personal information are not allowed.


NO SELF-PROMOTION

- Promoting yourself, or your site, is not allowed.

- Comments linking to external guides are not allowed, unless my guide is wrong or missing information. An official source of information is preferred in these cases.


SPEAK ENGLISH

- This policy is not strictly enforced. I request comments match the language of the article (which is  exclusively English).

- I do not object to poor or machine-translated English.
